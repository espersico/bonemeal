Hello! 

I've added the tiles here as well as a sample file in .psd that has a layer with Mordley in it so you can use it to preview how each tile looks to her for ground/floor. They also can be used for either floor or wallpaper (some are a little more obvious as floors). 

They are .PNG file and 32x32 each. 

Let me know if you have any questions, or if you need modifications or recolors on these, or any more.

I'll be adding more of the assets within tonight and tomorrow.
